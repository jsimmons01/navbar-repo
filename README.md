# Navbar Repo

## Description

I am learning how to do simple projects so eventually I can use the things that I learned to build a useful project or to elevate my teacher comment generator. 

## What did I learn?
I learned that JavaScript has a built-in toggle class. It is used specifically to add and remove a class name from an element. In this case instead if writing a conditional to see if the classList contains "show-links" and add or remove, I used the toggle reach the same goal. It is less code and easier to read. 

##What could I do differently?

Make sure I complete the navbar this week!
