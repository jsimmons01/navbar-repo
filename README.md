# Navbar Repo

## Description

I am learning how to do simple projects so eventually I can use the things that I learned to build a useful project or to elevate my teacher comment generator. 

## What did I learn?
I learned that JavaScript has a built-in toggle class.

##What could I do differently?

Make sure I complete the navbar this week!
